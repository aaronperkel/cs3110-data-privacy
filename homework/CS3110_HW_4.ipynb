Since each operation consumes a privacy budget of epsilon/2, the total privacy cost of the function remains bounded by epsilon, ensuring that the function adheres to differential privacy guarantees.\n",
    "2. Importance of Clipping Parameter vs. Noise Scale:\n",
    "- For both sums and averages, the value of the clipping parameter b is generally more important for accuracy. Clipping limits the influence of extreme values (outliers), which reduces the sensitivity of the query and, in turn, the amount of noise added. A well-chosen clipping parameter significantly improves accuracy because it directly controls the impact of noise by bounding the range of data. If the clipping parameter is too large, the noise added may become excessive, affecting the accuracy of the result.\n",
    "3. Applicability to All Datasets:\n",
    "- The importance of the clipping parameter may not hold for all datasets. For datasets with a fairly uniform or narrow distribution, the scale of the noise added might be more critical for accuracy than clipping, as extreme values are less of a concern. However, in datasets with outliers or highly skewed distributions, clipping becomes essential to prevent large deviations in the results due to a few data points. Therefore, the significance of clipping vs. noise scale is context-dependent, and both need to be considered based on the datasetâ€™s characteristics."

    "- The strategy for implementing auto_avg involved first automatically determining a clipping parameter, b, based on the 99th percentile of the data. Clipping limits the influence of extreme values. I then split the privacy budget epsilon equally between the sum and count queries, using the Laplace mechanism to add noise. Finally, I calculated the differentially private average by dividing the noisy sum by the noisy count.\n",
    "2. Privacy Cost Argument:\n",
    "- The total privacy cost of auto_avg is bounded by epsilon. I split the privacy budget evenly between the sum and the count operations, allocating epsilon/2 to each. Since both operations adhere to the Laplace mechanismâ€™s guarantees, the combined privacy cost of the function is the sum of the two, which equals epsilon.\n",
    "3. Solution Performance:\n",
    "- The solution worked well for all three example columns after adjusting the clipping parameter to the 99th percentile. Initially, it didnâ€™t work well for the fnlwgt column because the values were much larger and more skewed, requiring more aggressive clipping. After this adjustment, the solution handled all columns adequately.\n",
    "4. When the Solution May Not Work Well:\n",
    "- The solution might not work well with datasets that have extremely skewed or heavy-tailed distributions, where even the 99th percentile doesnâ€™t effectively limit outliers. Additionally, if the dataset is very small or has a high proportion of outliers, the added noise could disproportionately affect the result, leading to less accurate differentially private averages."
